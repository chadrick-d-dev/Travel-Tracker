## About the Project
This project is part of Turing Software and Designs' Front-End Program, Module 2. Travel Tracker is a simple muli-class application that uses Webpack, and other API's. The purpose behind this project was to demonstrate understanding of class encapsulation, robust test driven development, and code review skills. The goal was to create an accessible travel app where travelers could view their past, present, future, and pending trips, as well as submit new trips for approval. The data for travelers, destinations, and trips were obtained using GET fetch, and new trips were submitted using POST fetch. Objects classes, and API's were expected to handle data in the apps.
